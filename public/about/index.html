			<p>I am currently a cryptographer at <a href="https://semiotic.ai">Semiotic Labs</a> primarily working as a core dev. on <a href="https://thegraph.com">The Graph</a> protocol and am very excited about the new interactions unlocked by web3. I am interested in all things cryptography, from theory to practice: zkSNARKs, fhe, mpc, pqc, &hellip; side-channel attacks. I can do some math (but don&rsquo;t consider myself a mathematician) and can do some coding and can play around with hardware.</p>
<p>Before helping to build web3, I was a senior prinicipal anti-tamper systems engineer at Northrop Grumman Corp., where I built resilient systems that can defend IP from the many attacks that can be launched from as close as a lab bench. Before that I was a cyber security researcher at Sandia National Labs, where I learned how to launch and defend against many attacks that can be performed from as close as a lab bench (and from further away). I got my MSEE from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2012), where I studied some cryptography and information theory. I got my BSEE w/ Supplementary Math Major from New Mexico State University (2009) where I was primarily interested in signal processing and probability theory.</p>
<p>For those who need it, <a href="../keys/pubkey.gpg">here</a> is my GPG Public Key.</p>
