      <description>I am currently a cryptographer at Semiotic Labs primarily working as a core dev. on The Graph protocol and am very excited about the new interactions unlocked by web3. I am interested in all things cryptography, from theory to practice: zkSNARKs, fhe, mpc, pqc, &amp;hellip; side-channel attacks. I can do some math (but don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a mathematician) and can do some coding and can play around with hardware.
Before helping to build web3, I was a senior prinicipal anti-tamper systems engineer at Northrop Grumman Corp.</description>
