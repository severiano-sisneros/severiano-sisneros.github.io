I am currently a cryptographer at [Semiotic Labs](https://semiotic.ai) primarily working as a core dev. on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com) protocol and am very excited about the new interactions unlocked by web3. I am interested in all things cryptography, from theory to practice: zkSNARKs, fhe, mpc, pqc, ... side-channel attacks. I can do some math (but don't consider myself a mathematician) and can do some coding and can play around with hardware. 

Before helping to build web3, I was a senior prinicipal anti-tamper systems engineer at Northrop Grumman Corp., where I built resilient systems that can defend IP from the many attacks that can be launched from as close as a lab bench. Before that I was a cyber security researcher at Sandia National Labs, where I learned how to launch and defend against many attacks that can be performed from as close as a lab bench (and from further away). I have a MSEE from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2012), where I studied some cryptography, and a BSEE w/ Supplementary Math Major from New Mexico State University (2009).

For those interested, [here](/pubkey.gpg/) is my GPG Public Key.
