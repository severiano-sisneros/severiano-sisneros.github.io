This was a panel I participated in at ETHDenver 2023, chaired by Aaron Greenblatt of [Ironmill](https://www.ironmill.xyz/).

>"There is great excitement surrounding the potential applications for newly-introduced zero knowledge (zk) proof systems. However, today, there are barriers to mass adoption of zk verifiable computing: zk proof generation involves many end-user mathematical choices; is computationally intense, and; leverages a wide array of software languages and libraries. Accordingly, widespread adoption of zk will require additional practical, operational infrastructure. We call this infrastructure zkOps.
>
>Join us for a panel discussion on current zk development and deployment strategies and on future avenues for zkOps tooling. Since both zk proofs and many Web2 workloads fundamentally rely on computation, there are parallels between existing Web2 devops infrastructure and future zkOps tools; we compare and contrast these techniques during this discussion. Our goal in this talk is to engage with the developer community to build consensus around future zkOps infrastructure priorities."
